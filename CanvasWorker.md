## Canvas Worker

To get the best performance we wan to use webworkers and the offscreen vanvas API.
As of 2022-06-03 the Safari and Firfox doesn't support it but it is in active development.
I beleive that eventually it will be a necessary addition. Especially if we want to render movies and stuff.
